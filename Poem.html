     In the dance of dawn and dusk we find,<br>
     Life's tapestry, both cruel and kind.<br>
     Through valleys low and mountains high,<br>
     We journey on beneath the sky.<br><br>
     In youth's embrace, with hearts so free,<br>
     We dream of all that yet may be,<br>
     Bold ambitions, hopes ablaze,<br>
     Chasing sunsets, counting days.<br><br>
     Yet time, relentless, swiftly flows,<br>
     A river where our story goes.<br>
     Through trials faced and battles won,<br>
     In every setting of the sun.<br><br>
     or life is not just joy or pain,<br>
     But echoes of a soft refrain.<br>
     In laughter shared and tears we cry,<br>
     In learning how to say goodbye.<br><br>
     Each moment whispers, fleeting, dear,<br>
     A melody we hold so near.<br>
     In love's embrace and friendship's bond,<br>
     We find the strength to carry on.<br><br>
     So let us savor, while we can,<br>
     This fleeting dance, this cosmic plan.<br>
     For in the end, when all is said,<br>
     Life's truest beauty lies ahead.<br>
