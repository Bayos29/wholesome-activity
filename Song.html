  <h3>[Verse 1]</h3><br>
    I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot<br>
    I left the party with a Barbie, marking X on the dot<br>
    She calls my phone up, but I told her, "I'm a loner" (Uh)<br>
    But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)<br>
    We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash<br>
    She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash<br>
    But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard<br>
    I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance<br>

  <h3>[Chorus]</h3><br>
    I gave up my heart(Uh)<br>
    Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain<br>
    Shе took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain<br>
    This beat in my dancе is not for romance<br>
    I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)<br>
    So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby<br>
    No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh, yeah (Uh)<br>
    No, I won't dance again (I)<br>
    No, I won't dance again<br>
    Pretty baby, ooh<br>

  <h3>[Verse 2]</h3><br>
    Face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky<br>
    She's got my pager, blankets of love fall on my eyes<br>
    Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it<br>
    I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh<br>
    The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd<br>
    You got the notion that somebody else was with me first<br>
    But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard<br>
    You took away my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance<br>

  <h3>[Chorus]</h3><br>
    I gave up my heart(Uh)<br>
    Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain<br>
    Shе took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain<br>
    This beat in my dancе is not for romance<br>
    I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)<br>
    So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby<br>
    No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh, yeah (Uh)<br>
    No, I won't dance again (I)<br>
    No, I won't dance again<br>
    Pretty baby, ooh<br>
